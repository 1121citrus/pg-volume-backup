# Security considerations

This document describes the security model, known limitations, and recommended
hardening steps for `pg-volume-backup`.

## Threat model

The service runs as a scheduled container that:

1. Optionally stops labeled Docker Compose services to quiesce volumes.
2. Runs `pg_dump` against a PostgreSQL instance over the internal network,
   or tars raw Docker volumes.
3. Optionally compresses and encrypts archives with GPG (AES-256).
4. Uploads archives and SHA-256 checksums to an S3 bucket.

Trusted components: the container host, the Docker daemon, the internal
network path to PostgreSQL, the S3 bucket (access-controlled by IAM), and
the Docker socket (used only to stop/start labeled containers).

## Credential handling

All credentials — AWS access keys, GPG passphrase, database password — are
supplied via Docker secrets mounted at `/run/secrets/`.  The `_FILE` variant
of each variable reads the secret file at startup rather than accepting the
value as a plain environment variable.

**Never pass credentials as plain environment variables in production.**
Plain env vars are visible in `docker inspect` output and process listings.

The `startup` script redacts `DB_PASSWORD` and `GPG_PASSPHRASE` from log
output before writing them to the env file.

## Docker socket exposure

Stopping and restarting labeled containers requires the Docker socket
(`/var/run/docker.sock`).  The socket grants root-equivalent access to the
Docker daemon.  Mitigations:

- Mount the socket read-write only when container stop/start is required.
- If all volumes use `pg_dump` (no raw-tar volumes), the socket mount can
  be omitted entirely.
- Restrict which containers the backup service can reach via Docker network
  isolation.

## S3 hardening recommendations

- Use a dedicated IAM user or role with the minimum required permissions:
  `s3:PutObject` and `s3:GetObject` for the backup bucket prefix.
- Use a separate IAM credential for `rotate-aws-backups` with only
  `s3:DeleteObject` and `s3:ListBucket`.
- Enable S3 bucket versioning and MFA Delete for additional protection
  against accidental or malicious deletion.
- Consider enabling S3 server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) as a
  second layer alongside GPG client-side encryption.
